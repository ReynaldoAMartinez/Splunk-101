# What I learned about these Splunk Add-on

The Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows is designed to collect and parse log data from Windows operating systems, including Windows Event Logs, performance metrics, Active Directory logs, and DNS debug logs.

The Splunk Add-on for Sysmon is designed to collect data from the Windows Event Log channel specifically used by Microsoft Sysmon: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational.
