# Splunk 101

# Purpose

Through this project I gained practical understanding of what Splunk is, how to deploy it and how to use it effectively to query, visualize, identify, correlate, investigate, and respond to security data.

# Main takeaways covered in this learning

🧩 Deploy and configure Splunk

☁️ Ingest and parse logs

🛰️ Create alerts, dashboards, and scheduled reports

🛡️ Complete a SOC investigation capstone to analyze a simulated compromise involving MITRE ATT&CK phases: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, and Command and Control, with the goal to understand how to identify, correlate, and investigate each stage using Splunk data

# Project Overview

The project is divided in sixteen lessons, ten labs, and one capstone challenge. Using Splunk, this learning aims to demonstrate what a contemporary SIEM does.

# Objective

Through this project I gained practical understanding of what Splunk is, how to deploy it and how to use it effectively to query, visualize, and respond to security data.
Main takeaways covered in this learning are:
- Deploy and configure Splunk
- Ingest and parse logs
- Create alerts, dashboards, and scheduled reports
- Complete a SOC investigation capstone to analyze a simulated compromise involving MITRE ATT&CK phases: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, and Command and Control, with the goal to understand how to identify, correlate, and investigate each stage using Splunk data.

<h2>Environments Used </h2>



- <b>VMWare Worstation</b>
- <b>Windows 11 </b> 
- <b>Ubuntu Server 22.04</b>
- <b>Splunk</b>


The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

Skills Learned
